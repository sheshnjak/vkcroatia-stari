      <h1>About water polo</h1>
      <p> Forerunner of water polo was the game that originated 1869. in Glasgow, 
        Scotland. Monotonous swimming tournaments and competitions needed something 
        different in their program, so the Scottish game became a popular way 
        to refresh and animate the audience. Few years after that London Swimming 
        Association formed special commission to define rules of the game. On 
        1876. Bournemouth Rowing Club defined water polo field dimensions (50 
        yd = 46 m), seven player teams, and main plus two line referees. At that 
        moment playing field did not have goals yet, and the goal was to set the 
        ball on the opponents raft.<br />
        Scotsman William Wilson (born 1844. in London) is considered being the 
        father of water polo. In the year 1876. he has released first rules of 
        water polo game, and by that rules first water polo game ever took place 
        on the river Dee.<br />
        As water polo evolved game rules were changing to make it more dynamic, 
        faster and more interesting to the audience. Most important change to 
        the modern water polo happened in 1950. by cutting out the rule that forbade 
        players to change position after the referees whistle. After that water 
        polo became much more dynamic, more counterattacks were possible and it 
        gave much more advantage to faster swimmers.</p>
      <h2> International water polo contests</h2>
      <p> Water polo became an Olympic sport very early, on the 2nd modern Olympic 
        Games (Paris 1900.). Besides water polo there was another sport with ball 
        that became Olympic sport - football. These two sports are the first team 
        sports on Olympic Games ever. First Olympic winner in water polo was Great 
        Britain. In the history of Olympic Games most successful was Hungary (8 
        gold, 3 silver, 3 bronze medals), Yugoslavia (3 gold, 4 silver, 2 bronze 
        medals), USSR (2 gold, 4 silver, 3 bronze medals), Italy (3 gold, 1 silver, 
        2 bronze medals) and Great Britain (4 gold medals). Women water polo became 
        an Olympic sport at Sydney 2000. Olympic Games.<br />
        Croatian players participated Olympic Games as part of Yugoslav teams 
        until the 1992. Atlanta Olympic Games (Croatia gained independency in 
        1990.). By that time 54 Croatian water polo players have played most important 
        role in Yugoslav team. 17 of them won the gold medals, and 4 of them have 
        won two gold medals. It was not only that way on Olympic Games, but in 
        all water polo contests and tournaments. After Croatia gained independency 
        Croatian water polo team won silver medal on their first Olympic Games.<br />
        First water polo World championship took place 1073. in Belgrade. Hungary 
        won the gold medal, USSR silver and Yugoslavia bronze medal. Through the 
        past of water polo World championships most successful countries are Italy, 
        Yugoslavia, Hungary, and USSR (all of them with two gold medals). The 
        biggest Croatia national team success was the fourth place on World championship 
        in Rome, 1994.<br />
        On the first European championship, that took place 1926. in Budapest, 
        Hungary national team won the gold medal, Sweden took silver and Germany 
        bronze medal. Most successful country on European championships is Hungary 
        (12 gold, 4 silver, 2 bronze medals), followed by USSR (5 gold, 3 silver, 
        2 bronze medals), Yugoslavia (1 gold, 8 silver, 4 bronze medals), Germany 
        (2 gold, 4 silver, 2 bronze medals), Italy (3 gold, 1 silver, 5 bronze 
        medals). The fact that first Yugoslav national team that competed on European 
        championship 1947. in Monte Carlo was consisted of all Croatian players 
        tells us how water polo was developed and popular in Croatia. Following 
        two European championships tell us the same story: Yugoslav national team 
        was in fact Croatian national team. After independency Croatian national 
        team has great success European championships: five times among four best 
        teams, out of six championships.</p>
      <h2> Water polo in Croatia</h2>
      <p> Water polo was brought to Croatia from Austria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary 
        and Germany by Croatian students. 1908. group of students from Split, 
        that has learned water polo in Prague, played first water polo game in 
        Croatia. First official water polo section in Croatia was H©K Victorija 
        from Su¹ak (founded 1919.). Since 1920. water polo was played in Baluni 
        and Firule, both sport clubs from Split. Students from Zagreb brought 
        water polo to Zagreb from Wienna, and founded water polo section in HA©K. 
        First international game was played in Split versus British ship Brionny 
        crew, and Croatian team won by 9:0. In Dubrovnik water polo club Jug was 
        founded in 1923. Jug was the most successful club between two world wars: 
        they won 13 Yugoslav championships in a row starting with 1925. After 
        2nd world war most successful was Partizan (Belgrade), followed by Mladost 
        (Zagreb), Mornar (Split), Jadran (Split) and Jug (Dubrovnik).<br />
        Water polo is most successful Croatian sport. Only in elite club competition 
        - Champions league (ex Championships cup) Croatian clubs have won 12 gold 
        medals, no other country has accomplished that much in Champions league. 
        Mladost from Zagreb is the most successful European water polo club. Mladost 
        has won seven European championships (1968, 1969, 1970, 1972, 1990, 1991. 
        and 1996.). VK Jug (Dubrovnik) has won the Champions league on 1981, 1999. 
        and 2001. and VK Jadran (Split) has won in 1992. and 1993. It even happened 
        that two Croatian teams play Champions league final match few times. Croatian 
        water polo league was the strongest world league for a long time, but 
        now the Italian league is stronger (richer) and many Croatian players 
        are playing big part in it.<br />
        Because of very good water polo school and its popularity in Croatia younger 
        categories are also very successful in international competitions. Their 
        best success is definitely gold medal from world junior championship in 
        Havana 1997.</p>
