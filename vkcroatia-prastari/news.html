      <p><a name="revijalna" id="revijalna">Tuesday, 17.8.2004. revial match</a><br />
        16.8.2004.<br />
        On Tuesday, 17.8.2004. match between 
        older players of Croatia vs. junior team will be played on Tuesday, 17.8.2004. 
        at 9 pm.</p>
      <p><a name="sezona" id="sezona">Competing part of season is over</a><br />
        15.8.2004.<br />
        Last 10th round of III. HVL, division &quot;©ibenik&quot; is over. Croatia 
        Turanj team has won only one match and have ended the season as last. 
        Considering that this was the first season of this team and very thin 
        club budget, which disabled club management to get a few extra players 
        aside from our players from Turanj, season can be called a success. Senior 
        team needed one more center, which was visible through the whole season, 
        while other positions were relatively successfully filled with our junior 
        players (which is really good management strategy, since club goal is 
        raising young water polo players from Turanj). Next season will undoubtedly 
        bring better results, at least in Turanj (since this year is not very 
        good for young categories in nearby clubs). Juniors team has competed 
        only with Zadar this season (and Gusar women team - out of competition). 
        Water polo season in Turanj is not over yet: juniors still have to continue 
        interrupted match with Gusar, and the memorial match will be played in 
        memoriam of Danijel Mandiæ.</p>
      <p><a name="zadar2" id="zadar2">Juniors defeated by Zadar again</a><br />
        11.8.2004.<br />
        Second game between juniors Croatia Turanj vs. Zadar 1952 ended with score 
        5:13 in favor Zadar 1952. Once again the key advantage of Zadar team was 
        the fact that they have trainings during whole year. But this time Croatia 
        Turanj juniors succeeded in preventing Zadar counterattacks (which sunk 
        them in <a href="#zadar">previous match</a> versus Zadar). They forced 
        Zadar on more-less static game, in which they couldn't be as good but 
        it was much better than previous match. Zadar has few outstanding players 
        (which even play in Zadar seniors team). Again, the best player was Igor 
        ©ariæ with five goals scored and great defense play.</p>
      <p><a name="gusarice2" id="gusarice2">Juniors match versus Gusar interrupted</a><br />
        4.8.2004.<br />
        Juniors match versus Gusar was interrupted by rain and strong wind. At 
        the moment of interruption the score was 4:2 in favor of Gusar. Match 
        will be continued, and new date will be appointed with Gusar water polo 
        club.</p>
      <p><a name="tisno2" id="tisno2">Tisno defeated Croatia Turanj</a><br />
        1.8.2004.<br />
        Croatia Turanj seniors team is now last on <a href="seniors.html">standings 
        table</a> for III. HVL ©ibenik division. After today's poor play they 
        have fallen to the last position. Match has finished with score of 14:2 
        in favor of Tisno.</p>
      <p><a name="gusar" id="gusar">Gusar sunk Croatia</a><br />
        30.7.2004.<br />
        Croatia Turanj seniors team were sunk at the hardest away match in league. 
        Gusar team is absolutely strongest, and has a perfect score of all five 
        matches won and score line of 74:23. From what we have seen so far, they 
        are the first candidate for III. HVL division ©ibenik champions.</p>
      <p><a name="brodarica" id="brodarica">SeniorS lost from Brodarica</a><br />
        25.7.2004.<br />
        In spite of rain and bad weather a match Croatia Turanj vs. Brodarica 
        was played, and Brodarica won by 6:2. Guest team entered the match better 
        and capitalized that by playing M-zone almost during whole match. Our 
        shooters did not respond to their defense well, and the match was lost 
        by the halftime. Rest of the match was much the same, except for the fact 
        that Croatia compacted a little and played a better defense.</p>
      <p><a name="primosten" id="primosten">First match lost in Turanj</a><br />
        23.7.2004.<img src="slike/croatia-primosten-23-07-04.jpg" align="right" /><br />
        Match Croatia Turanj vs. Primo¹ten ended with score of 5:14. From the 
        very beginning guest team dominated both in attack and defense segments. 
        Our team lost concentration at the beginning when they unforcedly lost 
        few balls (from which guest team scored), and then it started to go bad. 
        In spite of pretty equal team quality Primo¹ten used poor home team motivation 
        and, by using strong pressing that transformed into zone at the endings 
        of our attack time, went into the big lead.</p>
      <p><a name="zadar" id="zadar">Juniors lost in Zadar</a><br />
        21.7.2004.<br />
        In the juniors match versus Zadar 1952 our team was defeated by 22:3. 
        Zadar team were much better swimmers, which is normal considering that 
        they have had trainings during whole year. Mostly from counterattacks 
        they have accomplished really big score of 15:0 by halftime, and later 
        they only had to finish the match against weaker and broken opponent.</p>
      <p><a name="tisno" id="tisno">Victory over Tisno</a><br />
        20.7.2004.<br />
        <img src="slike/tisno.jpg" align="left" /> Postponed match Croatia Turanj 
        vs Tisno that should have been played 16.7.2004. was played today and 
        finished with score 7:5 in favor of Croatia. Even if it's not obvious 
        from the final score our players started the match really well and had 
        score 4:0 on halftime. They entered third quarter relaxed and finished 
        it with 6:1. Later on, in last quarter, younger players entered the game 
        and finished it peacefully. After this match played Croatia Turanj has 
        two points and is standing solidly in the situation where four teams have 
        by two points from one match won and one lost.</p>
      <p><a name="zpk" id="zpk">Seniors defeated by ZPK</a><br />
        18.7.2004.<br />
        Croatia Turanj seniors have lost their very first match this season. They 
        were defeated by ZPK with score 15:2. Team from Zagreb scored most of 
        their goals from counteroffensive, using the fact that they are the only 
        team in this division who have closed swimming pool and trainings during 
        whole year. Our best player was the goalkeeper who helped us not to lose 
        with even bigger score. During whole match ZPK was much better trained 
        and more complete team, while our team had troubles with physical condition.</p>
      <a name="gusarice" id="gusarice">First juniors match tie</a><br />
      14.7.2004.<br />
      Match between Croatia Turanj and Gusar ended with score of 7:7. At first 
      part of match Gusar team was better and they had advantage of 2 goals at 
      halftime, but our team continued better and accomplished to equalize until 
      the end of the match. </p>
