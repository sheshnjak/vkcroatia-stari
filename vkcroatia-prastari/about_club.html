  <h1>About water polo club Croatia Turanj</h1>
  <p><a href="photo_gallery.html"><img src="slike/grb-180x240.gif" align="right" alt="water polo club Croatia Turanj emblem" border="0" /></a>Water 
    polo club Croatia Turanj was founded in the year 1949. and nowdays it counts 
    about 30 members. Teams from our club are continually competing in regional 
    leagues for younger categories, and depending on circumstances club teams 
    participate in senior competitions, too. In 2004. season it is expected that 
    Croatia Turanj will compete in categories of junior and senior (third Croatian 
    league). Because there is no closed swimming pool nearby team trainings and 
    competitions take place only in Summer (as all Croatian regional leagues 
    do).</p>
  <p>At the moment club management is consisted of president Ðoni Rota, vice-president 
    Nikola Dekoviæ, board members: Ivan Dekoviæ, Ive Rota, Josip Santini, Krunoslav 
    Santini and Nado Santini, and supervising board: Bo¹ko Santini, Damir Santini 
    and Ivan Santini.</p>
  <h2> Club history</h2>
  <p>Soon after WWII young boys from Turanj had to leave their homes and went 
    to school, mostly to Zadar. In Zadar they have seen the game of water polo 
    for the first time, and when they were coming home for holidays they used 
    to play water polo in local port. In the year 1949 they organized and played 
    for the first time, and that was the beginning of water polo in Turanj. First 
    genuine water polo ball was brought to Turanj by Damir Èoriæ, and first goal 
    was brought and bought from Zadar for 100 000 dinars.</p>
  <p><img src="slike/1958.jpg" align="right" />At 
    the beginning very few really knew how to play, so the winners would usually 
    be the team that had stronger players and better swimmers. At that time they 
    were competing nearby teams from St. Filip and Jakov, Biograd, Zadar, Betina, 
    I¾ and Preko. First generation of players was made up of: Anðelko and Milorad 
    Boliæ, Ive Dekoviæ (Muto), Sveto Jaèan, Davor Mandiæ, Ivo Mi¹uliæ, Emil and 
    Ante Pedisiæ, Fedor and Zvone Piroviæ, Ka¾imir Rota, and of Bo¾idar (Perin), 
    Bo¾idar (Bo¾in), Davor, Drago and Pave Santini. Ive Matulj and priest Frane 
    Mandiæ were on the team lead. First competing phase lasted up to 1965, when 
    competitions faded, but interest for water polo in Turanj was never lost.</p>
  <p><img src="slike/1972.jpg" align="left" />Competitions 
    were again continued at the late 70's. New management (mostly consisted of 
    old club members), reassembled the team that competed with Bjelovar, Osijek, 
    Borovo, Hvar, ©ipan, Rogoznica and Mornar and Veteran (both teams from Split) 
    within Republic league. With time, water polo became so popular in Turanj that 
    diverse tournaments for cadet, junior and senior teams were organized (few 
    of them even on republic level). Among people that contributed club with their 
    knowledge most prominent was Zlatko ©imenc, very well known water polo professional 
    (today professor on Zagreb university). That team existed till mid 80's, when 
    financial troubles appeared and competing was stopped again.</p>
  <p> On year 1994 water polo club Croatia was revitalized, with great help from 
    prof. Zoran Vrkiæ. He raised extremely talented generation born between 1980 
    and 1982, which dominated in cadet and junior competitions among Biograd, 
    Betina and Zadar. In 1997 season Croatia successfully participated in the third, 
    and seasons 1998 and 1999 in the second state league.</p>
  <p>On 50th anniversary of water polo being played in Turanj, Croatian national 
    team leaded with Neven Kovaèeviæ, joined the jubilee game and played together 
    with local players.<br />
